.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unzip
will list, test, or extract from a ZIP archive, commonly found on MSDOS
systems.
Archive member extraction is implied by the absence of the -c, -p, -t, 
-l, -v or -z options.  All archive members are processed unless a
.B filespec
is provided to specify a subset of the archive members.
The
.B filespec
is similar to an egrep expression, and may contain:
.sp 1
.in +8
.ti -8
*       matches a sequence of 0 or more characters
.ti -8
?       matches exactly 1 character
.ti -8
\\nnn    matches the character having octal code nnn
.ti -8
[...]   matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges
are specified by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending
character.  If a '!' follows the left bracket, then the range
of characters matched is complemented with respect to the ASCII
character set.
